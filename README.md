# Game-of-Life
I built this program for my Data Structures and Algorithms course (CS 231) to simulate Conway's Game of Life. Here is the description of the project: "This week we'll explore the simulation of entities on a 2D grid. The entities will interact with each other to determine how they change over time. The overall concept is called cellular automata, and you'll implement a specific version of cellular automata that implement Conway's Game of Life. Please at least skim the wikipedia page if you have not seen the Game of Life before."
